#Thiago Bastos
Feature: Add Group Criterion
  As the teacher
  I want to be able to register new criteria
  So I can evaluate the students with these criteria

#Controller Scenario
  Scenario: Register a group of criteria that does not exist
    Given the criterion "C1" is not on the system
    And the criterion with name "C2" is also not on the system
    When I create the group of criteria "C1;C2"
    Then the criterion "C1" is added to the system
    And the criterion "C2" is also properly added to the system

#GUI Scenario
  Scenario: Register a non-existent group of criteria
    Given I can not see the criterion "C3"
    And I can not see the criterion "C4"
    And I am at the Add Group of Criteria page
    When I fill the field Nome with the name "C3;C4"
    And I finalize the criteria registration
    Then I should see the "C3" criterion available on the criteria list
    And I should see the "C4" criterion available on the criteria list

#Controller Scenario
  Scenario: Register a group of criteria that some of them already exists
    Given the criterion with name "C5" isnt on the system
    And the criterion with name "C9" is on the system
    When I register the group of criteria "C5;C9"
    Then the criterion "C5" is in the system
    And the criterion "C9" is not added to the system

#GUI Scenario
  Scenario: Register a group of criteria that some elements of it already exists
    Given I can not see the criterion "C6"
    And I can see the criterion "C7"
    And I am at the Add Group of Criteria page
    When I fill the field Nome with the name "C6;C7"
    And I finalize the criteria registration
    Then I should see the "C6" criterion available on the criteria list
    And I should see the "C7" criterion only one time available on the criteria list
